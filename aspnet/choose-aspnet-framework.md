# Choose between ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core 

No matter the web application you are creating, ASP.NET has a solution for you: from enterprise web applications targeting Windows Server, to small microservices targeting Linux containers, and everything in between.

## ASP.NET

ASP.NET is a mature web platform that provides all the services that you require to build enterprise-class server-based web applications using .NET on Windows.

## ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core is a new open-source and cross-platform .NET framework for building modern cloud-based web applications on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

## Which one is right for me?
