Making Websites with ASP.NET
====================
by [Scott Hanselman](https://github.com/shanselman)

Scott Hanselman explains One ASP.NET and gives an overview of how to make a website with ASP.NET. ASP.NET is great for building standards-based websites with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. ASP.NET supports three approaches for making web sites. [ASP.NET Web Forms](../../../web-forms/index.md) uses controls and an event-model for component-based development. [ASP.NET MVC](../../../mvc/index.md) values separation of concerns and enables easier test-driven development. [ASP.NET Web Pages](../../../web-pages/index.md) prefers a single page model that mixes code and HTML markup. You can mix and match these techniques within one application depending on your needs - it's all One ASP.NET.
